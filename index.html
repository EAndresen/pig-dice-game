        On a turn, a player rolls the die repeatedly. The goal is to accumulate as many points as
        possible, adding up
        the numbers rolled on the die. However, if a player rolls a 1, the player's turn is over and any points they
        have accumulated during this turn are forfeited. Rolling a 1 doesn't wipe out your entire score from previous
        turns, just the total earned during that particular roll.
      </p>
      <p>
        A player can also choose to hold (stop rolling the die) if they do not want to take a chance of rolling a 1 and
        losing all of their points from this turn. If the player chooses to hold, all the points rolled during that
        turn are added to his or her score.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a player reaches a total of 100 or more points, the game ends and that player is the winner.
